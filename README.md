# SMS Spam Filter via Python3

This is an SMS Spam Filter application built using DearPyGUI on Python 3!

## Installation

First, go into your directory where you have stored the SMS Spam Filter application.

Next, you must install all the dependencies:

```bash
pip3 install random, pandas, string, nltk
```

Finally, you can run the application using python 3:

```bash
python3 app.py
```


## Usage

Once the application is running, paste any text message you receive into the text bar. Click the check button. If the message is returned in green, the message is unlikely to be spam. However, if it is red, you better believe it is spam!
